        <p><i>This recipe is from The New Best Recipe Book by Cooks Illustrated.</i></p>

        <h3><strong>ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>for the custard:</strong></p>
        <p>4 egg yolks*</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons lime zest*</p>
        <p>1 can condensed milk</p>
        <p>1/2 cup key lime juice*</p>
        <p><strong>for the crust:</strong></p>
        <p>1 cup crushed graham crackers*</p>
        <p>5 tablespoons butter, melted, salted recommended</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons sugar</p>
        <h3><strong>directions:</strong></h3>
        <p>Whisk the yolks with zest until the yolks take on a bit of a green color from the zest, a minute or two.</p>
        <p>Add condensed milk and lime juice, let sit for 30 min to thicken.  Meanwhile, make the crust.</p>
        <p>Combine all ingredients for crust, press into pie pan.</p>
        <p>Pour the custard into prepared crust, hit on the counter a bit to pop air bubbles.</p>
        <p>Bake at 325Â°F for 17-18 minutes.</p>
        <h3><strong>notes:</strong></h3>
        <p>-The higher quality egg, the better.</p>
        <p>-Use less if a sweeter pie is desried, a full 2 tablepsoons is quite the punch but very delicious.</p>
        <p>-It is not crucial to use key lime specifically, lime will do just fine and people often prefer it as it is a bit less stringent in taste.  Also, I recommend using a pre-bottled lime juice such as Nellie & Joe's as it will be more a more consistent flavor than juicing your own limes. </p>
        <p>-For the best flavor, use normal graham crackers and crush them yourself; pre-crushed is not as good.</p>
