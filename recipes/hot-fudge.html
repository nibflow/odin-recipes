        <h1>Hot Fudge Recipe</h1>
        <p><i>This recipe came from my grandmother.  I am unsure where it came from, but it is likely to be from a popular cookbook from the 1960s.</i></p>
    
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <p>1 1/2 cups sugar</p>
        <p>6 tablespoons milk</p>
        <p>6 tablespoons butter, salted recommended</p>
        <p>1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</p>
        <h3><strong>Directions:</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>1.</strong>  Add sugar, milk, and butter to a saucepan* over medium-high heat.</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong>  Heat to a full* boil, boil for 30 seconds.</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong>  Take off heat, add chips and stir until fully incorporated.</p>
        <h3><strong>Notes:</strong></h3>
        <p>-A heavy-bottomed saucepan is recommended for even cooking and to fully melt the chips into the fudge.</p>
        <p>-Take care that it is truly at a gentle but full boil.  If you start the 30 seconds while mixture is still at a simmer, it will not reach the proper temperature thus consistency.</p>
