        <p><i>This recipe allows you to make terribly indulgent muffins at home, no bakery needed here!!</i></p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>For the Muffin:</strong></p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>3/4 cups sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/3 cup any neutral oil</p>
        <p>1 egg, room temp ¹</p>
        <p>1/3 cup milk, room temp</p>
        <p>1 cup fresh blueberries</p>
        <p><strong>For the Topping: ²</strong></p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/3 cup cake flour</p>
        <p>1/4 cup butter, cold & cubed</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
        <p>Cream, room temp, separate from topping, do not include in it topping</p>
        <h3><strong>Directions:</strong></h3>
        <p>Combine all dry ingredients for the batter.</p>
        <p>Place oil into a 1 cup measuring cup, add the egg to this, and then add as much milk as needed to fill to the top.</p>
        <p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry, be sure to not over mix.  Just before fully combined, add the blueberries.</p>
        <p>Set mixture aside to rise.  To prepare the topping, cut the butter into the dry ingredients (leaving the cream aside).</p>
        <p>Butter a muffin tin. ³  You can use a standard size muffin pan, but I like to use the 'jumbo' size.</p>
        <p>Place batter into tins, ⁴ to the top, gently so as to not lose the volume of the batter.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle the topping over top.</p>
        <p><i>Add a couple spoonfulls of cream over each muffin.  Prepare a small (oven-safe) rammekin with some water and place in oven alongside the muffins. ⁵</i></p>
        <p>Bake at 400°F for 20-25 minutes (this will vary depending on size tin you use)</p>

        <h3><strong>Notes:</strong></h3>
        <p>¹  It is particularly important to have your ingredients at room temperature as this contributes to a nicely risen muffin top.</p>
        <p>²  Because I use the jumbo muffin tins (yielding 5-6 muffins), I only make half of the topping.</p>
        <p>³  Dark colored aluminum pans should always be chosen if possible rather than the lighter-colored type.  They just lead to a better final product.</p>
        <p>⁴  If you like, you can space the muffins out from each other in the tin to make them rise even more in the oven.  I personally find that it is not too important to do because we have other tricks involved here to help rise as well, but if you feel like combining all tricks to get a tall as possible, go for it!</p>
        <p>⁵  I emphasize these two points because they are the most important parts of making a homemade muffin as good as a bakery one.  You need that moisture!</p>
